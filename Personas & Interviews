Liam — The Punctual Efficientist

"I almost cycle in all weather conditions. I just need to know if there's a bike available so I won't be late for my 9 AM lecture."



Profile

Identity: Full-time UCD student with a part-time job.

Location: Lives in Portobello, Dublin 8 (a high-demand residential area for students).

Frequency: Heavy user, approximately 6 times per week.

Commute: Cycles from Portobello to the city bus corridor to catch a bus to UCD; cycles to work after class.



Goals & Behaviors

Punctuality: Needs to leave between 8:00–8:30 AM to catch his 9:00 AM lecture.

Pre-planning: Always checks bike availability on a phone or laptop before leaving his dorm to plan effectively.

Weather Hardy: Cycles in almost any Dublin weather except for snow or icy roads; uses weather info to choose attire.

Cashless Preference: Strictly prefers credit cards and long-term subscriptions over carrying cash.


Pain Points

Availability Anxiety: Arriving at a station with "no bikes" or "no free stands" causes him to be late and forced to walk.

High-Demand Area: Portobello stations often empty out right when he needs to depart for campus.

Safety Backup: Worries about faulty bikes; prefers journey planners that suggest routes passing more bike stations.



Digital & Interface Needs

Visual Intuition: Prefers color-coded availability on maps for quicker navigation over marker sizes.

Foresight: Values 30-minute ML predictions and hourly trend charts to feel more in control of his journey.

Top Priorities: His interface must feature Distance, Station Name, and Weather.
