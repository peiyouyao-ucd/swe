Liam — The Data-Driven Commuter

"Dublin traffic is unpredictable. I need a system that integrates predictions, weather, and account management so I can control every minute of my commute and every cent of my budget."



Profile

Identity: Full-time UCD student managing academic deadlines and a part-time job.

Location: Lives in Portobello, Dublin 8, an area where Dublin Bikes are the primary artery for local transit.

Route Logic: Cycles to the city bus corridor (e.g., Leeson St) for his "first-mile" commute to UCD Belfield; uses bikes for late-night returns from work.

Frequency: High-intensity user (6+ times per week).



Behaviors & Motivations

Proactive Planning: Liam’s commute is multi-modal. He uses Dublin Weather to choose his attire and ML Predictions to ensure a dock will be empty by the time he reaches the bus interchange 30 minutes later.

Cost-Efficiency: As a budget-conscious student, he uses the Annual Subscription. He relies heavily on the Rental Tracking timer to stay within the 30-minute free window, avoiding unnecessary surcharges.

Digital-First Lifestyle: He hates carrying physical change and relies on the Top-Ups feature to manage his account balance for single-use extensions or late fees.



Pain Points

Interrupted Flow: Arriving at a full station causes a "domino effect"—he misses his bus connection and ends up late for a 9 AM lecture.

Data Fragmentation: Frustrated by having to switch between weather apps, news sites, and bike apps to plan a single trip.

System Trust: Worries about faulty equipment; he needs the How-to guide for quick troubleshooting and Rental History to verify his billing accuracy.



Key Feature Requirements

Unified Dashboard: Wants real-time weather, Dublin News, and bike counts in one glance before leaving his room.

Visual Confidence: Values Trend Charts that show occupancy patterns (e.g., Wednesdays at 10 AM) to optimize his weekly schedule.

Engagement: Checks Special Offers for potential student-specific discounts or cycling gear rewards.
